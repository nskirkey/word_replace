# Word Replace 
This is a fun project I started after I realized the idea with a friend of mine. It is a script written in python and makes use of Worknik API for some translations.

It takes a block of text from a text file (input.txt) and produces a new block of text, where each word from the original has been replaced with it's phonetic spelling.

##  Two options for phonetic alphabets/notations
Internation Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet

American Heritage Dictionary phonetic notation - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetic_notation_of_the_American_Heritage_Dictionary
